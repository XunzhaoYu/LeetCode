"""
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:
    Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

    sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
    sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
    sumRange(0, 5) -> -3

Note:
    You may assume that the array does not change.
    There are many calls to sumRange function.
